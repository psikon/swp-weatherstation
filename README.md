# Software Project Weatherstation

This project is the result of an 9 days course for ongoing devolopers. The task was to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap project and parse the JSON response. Afterwards this response have to be stored in a database an queried for resonable data. 

The original task was to develop a console interface. Motivated by one student I decided to build a rest controller and a little React frontend to visualize the data by itself and improve the functionality by a bisc history function. 

## Installation

After checkout the backend can be started with maven
